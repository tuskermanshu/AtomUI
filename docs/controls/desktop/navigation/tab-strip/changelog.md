# TabStrip Changelog

本文档记录 TabStrip 控件级设计、API、主题契约、Token 和实现结构的变化。它不替代仓库根目录 `CHANGELOG.md`，也不作为正式版本发布说明。

## 2026-09-15

- Behavior
  - Revalidate the original source and logical tab after closing and selection callbacks; cancel a reorder commit when its callback mutates the source collection.
  - Apply owner close-button defaults to generated containers while preserving item overrides.
  - Abort overflow opening when snapshot notifications or template construction invalidate the session, and release abandoned content before it enters the popup tree.
- Theme
  - Measure card tabs and the add button along the placement axis, tolerate narrow arrangement, and center vertical Line tabs along the correct axis.
  - Respect RTL horizontal wheel direction and boundary scroll chaining while preserving vertical-wheel fallback.
- Verification
  - Replace the failed-open performance probe with a real overlay host and layout validation; supersede the earlier interaction percentages with a fresh matched-baseline report.

## 2026-09-14

- API
  - Add `OverflowPopupTemplate` to `BaseTabStrip`, inherited by `TabStrip` and `CardTabStrip`, using the shared public sealed `TabOverflowPopupContext` and immutable `TabOverflowItem` contract.
- Behavior
  - Align the Gallery custom overflow search with Ant Design Tabs: 200 px popup, clearable prefixed search, case-insensitive contains matching, 300 px scroll viewport, empty state, selected/disabled states, click activation and keyboard navigation.
  - Treat partially clipped headers as overflow and keep owner-controlled selection, close, light-dismiss and placement semantics.
  - Keep focus on the more-button when pointer-opening overflow; do not auto-focus the selected item, first item, popup root or search input.
  - Preserve and fully contain the overflow activator when the owner is narrowed by responsive masonry layout or a smaller final arrange.
  - Render custom-search item headers through the button content pipeline and keep the Popup shadow mask rounded to the final surface, including nested content presenters.
  - Hide the default and searchable overflow list scrollbars without disabling wheel, trackpad or programmatic scrolling, and keep item surfaces at equal left/right inset.
  - Replace the tab-track gradient masks with Ant Design's directional outer overflow shadows for Top, Bottom, Left and Right placement, using transparent paint carriers aligned with the scrolling viewport boundary.
- Architecture
  - Replace the duplicated TabControl/TabStrip viewers and menu items with one internal sealed `TabScrollViewer`, one static Popup shell and one shared default menu implementation.
  - Lazily create and cache popup content, clear session snapshots on ordinary close, and release popup child, cached root, context, subscriptions and owner references on template replacement or detach.
  - Track the final Popup surface through nested content presenters with explicit presenter-chain and corner-radius binding teardown so replaced surfaces remain collectible.
  - Position the static outer-shadow casters outside the scroll viewport and clip their output with an input-transparent Canvas; compiled bindings keep the inward caster faces aligned after resize or placement changes.
  - Correct the current Avalonia Skia shadow-offset transform inside the shared Tab edge renderer so overflow shadows retain their visible strength on Retina and scaled surfaces. Preserve logical shadow tokens and input-transparent clipping.
  - Add production Gallery page regressions for 1×/2× and dynamic display/ancestor scale coverage; assert visible contrast as well as bounds.
  - Add isolated Skia compositor-frame regressions covering all four owners and placements, Light/Dark, scroll boundaries, resize and non-overflowing state.
- Performance
  - Reuse the attached popup content root and clear per-open snapshots on close. Interaction performance is measured with a realized overlay host; see the corrected 2026-09-15 verification record.
  - Eliminate per-instance edge gradient brushes and gradient-stop allocations; scrolling now only updates indicator visibility.
- Token
  - Consume the TabControl family `BoxShadowTabsOverflowLeft`, `BoxShadowTabsOverflowRight`, `BoxShadowTabsOverflowTop` and `BoxShadowTabsOverflowBottom` Tokens, with `MenuEdgeThickness` derived from `ControlHeight`.
- Gallery
  - Add one shared searchable popup implementation and examples for `TabControl`, `CardTabControl`, `TabStrip` and `CardTabStrip`, including localized placeholder and empty-state text.
  - Make the overflow examples responsive with `MaxWidth` plus stretch alignment so fixed sample width cannot push the activator outside a narrow Gallery column.

## 2026-09-12

- Docs
  - Define the shared `TabControl` / `TabStrip` overflow popup architecture around one internal `TabScrollViewer`, a static template Popup shell, immutable per-open projections and owner-validated actions.
  - Define `OverflowPopupTemplate`, `TabOverflowPopupContext` and `TabOverflowItem` as the customization contract inherited by `TabStrip` and `CardTabStrip`.
  - Define lazy first-open content creation, cached visual reuse, close-time data clearing, full re-template/detach teardown and weak-owner retention invariants.
  - Add blocking performance, repeated open/close, DynamicResource, stale-context, Gallery navigation and NativeAOT verification gates.

- Token
  - Confirm that TabStrip continues to use SharedToken and TabControl family resources without a dedicated Token document.

## 2026-08-28

- Behavior
  - Route overflow close requests through `BaseTabStrip.CloseTab`, including mutable `ItemsSource` lists, and reject read-only or fixed-size sources without changing the source collection or flyout.

- Docs
  - Define overflow menu items as alternate presentations of the source `TabStripItem`, including propagation of effective `IsClosable` and `ContentTemplate` semantics.
  - Define `BaseOverflowMenuItemTheme` close-button visibility from `IsClosable`, and require overflow close requests to delegate to `BaseTabStrip.CloseTab` so `Closing`, cancellation, selection, collection and `Closed` semantics remain unified.
  - Require canceled or rejected closes to retain both the source tab and its overflow menu item; only a successful owner close may remove the menu item.

## 2026-08-25

- Docs
  - Add the shared Popup pinned-open design link and record BaseTabStrip as the semantic owner for TabStrip, with TabStripScrollViewer used only as the relay adapter.
  - Preserve ordinary close behavior after unpinning and allow lifecycle teardown to release the Popup host.

## 2026-08-18

- Behavior
  - Preserve each tab header's `ContentTemplate` in overflow menu items so `ItemTemplate` rendering remains consistent after a tab moves into the overflow menu.

## 2026-07-09

- Docs
  - Define `TabActivationTrigger` for `TabStrip`, with `PointerReleased` as the default pointer activation mode and `PointerPressed` as the opt-in immediate activation mode.
  - Document press/release same-Tab activation semantics, cancellation paths, reorder precedence and verification requirements.
  - Define Tab drag reorder API, events, axis model, collection commit semantics, lifecycle cleanup and verification boundaries for `TabStrip`.
  - Document that reorder must mutate logical `ItemsSource` / `Items` order instead of visual container order, and selection state must follow the same logical item after reorder.
  - Refine the reorder preview as a Chrome-style track-constrained model: dragged tabs move only on the placement main axis, overlapping siblings displace proportionally to avoid empty old slots, half-overlap switches the target index, sibling displacement is animated, the selected indicator follows preview transforms, and the dragged surface remains opaque.
  - Document the vertical placement icon-slot alignment model for mixed icon/no-icon tabs without adding public API or new tokens.
  - Document that default Line `Left` / `Right` spacing and item padding are compact and independent from Card spacing, and that `TabStripPlacement` changes must preserve the selected logical item without refreshing containers.

## 2026-06-26

- Docs
  - Add LLMS metadata, semantic parts and export source mapping for `TabStrip`.
  - Align generated output paths with `controls/tab-strip/index-cn.md` and `controls/tab-strip/semantic-cn.md`.

## 2026-06-24

- Docs
  - Complete TabStrip desktop architecture and implementation docs with source-derived API groups, template parts, state flow and verification boundaries.
  - Establish TabStrip desktop architecture documentation under `docs/controls/desktop/navigation/tab-strip/overview.md`.
  - Add TabStrip implementation documentation covering source ownership, state flow, lifecycle, resources, AOT boundaries and maintenance invariants.
  - Add TabStrip control-level changelog.
  - Document that TabStrip does not require a dedicated Token document and records its theme dependencies in the overview.
